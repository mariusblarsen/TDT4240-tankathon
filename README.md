## Project Description

### Background
Tankathon is an Android game built while taking NTNU’s software architecture course, TDT4240, taught by Alf Inge Wang. Therefore the background for the  development process has been to learn about architectural design.

### The game

### The technologies
The game is developed in using Kotling with the gamedevelopment framwork LibGDX and KTX. The LibDGX framework provides useful utilities and KTX provides Kotlin extension for the framework. Firebase is used as the database to keep track of highscores.
